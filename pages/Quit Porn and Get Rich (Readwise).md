	- We do not have to prove to ourselves and others what we are capable of. But what if we do not really know what we are capable of? (Location 84)

	- Your life can be rich in experience, rich in professional successes, rich in kindness to others, rich in family happiness, and materially rich as well. Or you can spend it in front of the computer, watching strangers copulating. (Location 89)

	- facts about the problem of pornography and guidelines on how to overcome an addiction to it are widely discussed and available on the Internet for free. I urge you to search for them. (Location 125) #Inbox
	- Releasing the sexual tension built up by a natural libido will not result in physical or psychological problems. What changes masturbation into something unhealthy, against human nature (substantially increasing frequency and compulsiveness [4] ), is pornography. (Location 147)
	  id:: 6282855a-2606-4f5e-af94-1fde8f7ab5d7
	- Why is it that sporadic cases of such behavior may lead to increased frequency or addiction? Because pornography and masturbation provide massive, momentary pleasure, (Location 152)
	- One of the people who investigated the porn issue is [[Gary Wilson]] , in his book, [[Your Brain on Porn]] (Location 184)

	- it has been reiterated for many years that masturbation is actually healthy for the male body. It’s just that medicine envisions masturbation aided by the imagination or gaudy magazines and grainy video tapes. These media—which are now rarely used—only offer a substitute for the sensations that modern high-quality pornography guarantees. (Location 212)

	- as many as 10% of the students participating in it admitted that pornography lessened their desire to find a real partner, and 16% of those viewing pornography at least once a week confirmed a decline in desire. There were no such cases among the participants who didn’t use pornography. (Location 219)

	- We are able to get an erection and have sex only thanks to the powerful release of dopamine [10] . A period of abstinence from pornography and sexual arousal can regenerate the receptors in the brain and can allow us to once again become satisfied with the normal doses of dopamine secreted before or during intercourse with a woman. (Location 228)

	- the longer someone has used porn and the higher quality it was, the longer the detox period will take. (Location 232)

	- The appearance of a new female increases dopamine levels, stimulating the reward system. (Location 244)

	- its aim is to encourage us to reproduce and to conceive as many children as possible. Unfortunately, it also works when a man’s brain sees a naked woman on a computer screen. When a man constantly sees the same woman, the brain quickly gets bored and the level of dopamine drops. (Location 245)
	  id:: 6282855a-6e73-45aa-bf85-e41f6a967b99
	- Watching pornography, particularly a series of new videos with new women, leads to sustained high levels of dopamine. This mechanism causes the viewer to become easily addicted to the constant hits of dopamine. (Location 248)
	  id:: 6282855a-2f23-45c5-a5fe-5ef1b1c8663a
	- the reward system becomes more and more resistant to low doses of dopamine, and after a while only new pornography can cause it to spike. (Location 250)
	  id:: 6282855a-c801-4cac-ac9b-cf8f87986ade
	- This is also one of the reasons why surfing the web is so engaging. Internet resources provide an ^^endless supply of novelties^^. (Location 253)
	- It’s easy to guess that a brain which has just seen dozens of naked women within a few minutes on the Internet is unlikely to be permanently stimulated by one real-life woman. The dopamine influx won’t be powerful enough to act on the reproductive organs. (Location 257)
	- This system rewards us with dopamine for food, reproduction, love, achievements, friendship, and novelty. The higher the dopamine production is during a given activity, the more we desire it. (Location 260)
	- However, the accumulation of large doses of dopamine destroys some of the receptors, and the brain becomes desensitized to smaller amounts of dopamine, which can lead to feeling down in the dumps. (Location 267)
	- dopamine is not just connected with rewards. It is also responsible for our pursuit of a reward, our anticipation, and desire. ^^Dopamine spurs incentive motivation^^; this is what pushes us to achieve long-term objectives and win potential prizes. When we are striving for a goal, small doses of dopamine are secreted naturally. Thanks to that, we become focused, our senses are sharpened, and our muscles can do more than usual. ^^The motivational feature of the reward system is essential for achieving happiness and satisfaction^^.

	- When we meet an attractive woman, the brain triggers a small rush of dopamine, which increases our level of motivation. This motivation encourages us to approach the woman, talk to her, impress her, and invite her somewhere. (Location 277)
	  id:: 62878498-9f21-4a46-b515-93e348305d98
	- Pornography objectifies women. As a result, the only thing that we come to expect from them is the rush from a large dose of dopamine. (Location 285)
	- constant virtual encounters with sexual stimuli anesthetize the reward system, a system that is based on small amounts of dopamine which are necessary for creating the motivation needed to maintain a normal relationship and finding a partner. (Location 287)
	- ^^We need motivation in order to work, learn, find ideas, build businesses, and to set life goals and realize them. It is not worth forfeiting such an important driving force of the body for temporary pleasures in the form of artificial stimuli.^^ (Location 290)

	- we subconsciously form a mental pattern, leading ourselves to believe that any other actions or efforts will not provide us with so much pleasure so easily. (Location 297)
	- supernormal stimulus. This is a stimulus whose effect on instinctive behavior is directly proportional to the level of its exaggeration. (Location 309)
	- What Tinbergen developed is called the supernormal stimulus. This is a stimulus whose effect on instinctive behavior is directly proportional to the level of its exaggeration. (Location 309)
	- sugar and fat became a very strong stimulus for collecting food and obtaining energy. (Location 313)
	- it takes approximately 70 days. (Location 331)
	- The ejaculate itself consists of valuable vitamins and minerals that are collected from the entire body. It is made up of enzymes, proteins, amino acids, flavonoids, zinc, selenium, and vitamin C. (Location 332)
	- The ejaculate itself consists of valuable vitamins and minerals that are collected from the entire body. It is made up of enzymes, proteins, amino acids, flavonoids, zinc, selenium, and vitamin C. Most of the chemicals necessary to create a new supply of sperm are also needed for the proper functioning of other organs. (Location 332)
	- A single ejaculation can cause a slight fatigue of the body, whereas frequent ejaculation can result in a deficiency of micronutrients and vitamins, and even faintness. (Location 335)
	- opinion—self-confidence has more to do with undertaking challenges, being competitive, taking risks, or being a leader. (Location 342)
	- production occurs chiefly in the testes and to a small extent in the adrenal glands (Location 351)
	- It plays a decisive role during sexual maturation, and in the development and growth of the sex organs. It also helps to build and maintain bone density, to increase muscle mass and strength, and to break down fat. It stimulates the production of red blood cells and semen. Thanks to testosterone, we feel confident, strong, level-headed, and calm; we easily cope with stressful situations and can manage risk. Testosterone kindles the need to discover and explore the world. There is a direct dependence, meaning that a high level of testosterone implies increased exploratory activity. (Location 352)
	- At the moment of a masturbation-induced orgasm, testosterone levels are relatively stable, and large amounts of noradrenaline, adrenaline, and prolactin are released into the bloodstream. [20] It is only in the case of regular masturbation that normal testosterone levels may decrease. (Location 360)
	- ^^The reason for falling testosterone levels may be a deficiency of the micronutrients which are necessary to produce testosterone^^ [22] —for example, zinc and selenium—and which masturbating too often can flush out of the body. (Location 366) #testosteron
	- ^^an elevated **prolactin** level for a longer time—through frequent masturbation, for example—can reduce **testosterone** levels.^^ (Location 370) #testosteron
	- Masturbation does not allow you to become satiated after sexual stimulation to the same extent as sex does, so you can assume that when this cycle is often repeated, elevated prolactin levels are sustained in the body. (Location 373)
	- One cause of decreased libido [24] is a sharp decrease in androgen receptors (i.e., testosterone receptors) in the hypothalamus due to masturbating too frequently. The result is that the body stops feeling the presence of testosterone and we start behaving as if we don’t have enough of it. (Location 374)
	- it can be concluded that sexual intercourse with a woman has an influence on increased testosterone levels in a man, (Location 383)
	- Lowered testosterone levels cause a lack of confidence, a feeling of less masculinity, fearfulness, and sociopathy. Men with low levels of testosterone often have soft bones, poorly developed muscle tissue, obesity, a greater tendency for gynecomastia (breast formation), an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, higher levels of bad cholesterol (LDL), and neurological and psychological problems. (Location 388)
	- excessive testosterone levels may cause bald spots, faster development of an enlarged prostate, lower good cholesterol levels (HDL), or fits of aggression. (Location 391)
	- The inflow of large doses of dopamine during stimulation and orgasm are a drain on the reward system, which may result in feelings of dejection and disappointment during other activities. (Location 402)
	- the amount of **prolactin** secreted after sex is up to 400% higher than the rise in prolactin after masturbation. [29] (Location 404)
	- depression is one of the main reasons why people develop addictions. (Location 408)
	- The reward system and the endocrine system, especially dopamine and **testosterone**, play a key role in a man’s life. Watching pornography and frequently masturbating can contribute to an imbalance in these systems, and thus of the body and of the functioning of the brain. This, in turn, can ruin your motivation, deprive you of pleasure from everyday things, lower your self-confidence, (Location 412)
